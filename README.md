# Evan-Bruns-Homepage

This is a prototype homepage to serve as a central point for the rest of my web presence. I am unsure if this is ever to
be intended for launch, since it (at least in its current form on 10/18/16) is distinctly web 1.0. It mainly serves as
practice for my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills, so I can get used to this technology and make fewer silly mistakes when I'm
trying to use these technologies for real projects.
